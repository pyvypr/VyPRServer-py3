# The central verdict server for VyPR

When a program is monitored with VyPR, the server with which VyPR interacts is this one.  This provides insertion and querying APIs.

## Setup

Once you've cloned this repository, you need to setup the verdict database.  For now, we use sqlite.  In the VyPR server root, run:

`sqlite3 verdicts.db < verdict-schema.sql`

to create the database file to which the server will write when it receives instrumentation and monitoring information from VyPR.

Finally, the server needs the Python 3 version of VyPR (http://github.com/pyvypr/VyPR-py3/) to be placed in the root directory of the server (eg, `VyPRServer/VyPR`).  Note that the version of VyPR needed by the server doesn't require you to follow any of the usual setup steps since VyPR is only needed on the server for certain classes it contains.

**VyPR must be found in the directory `VyPR/` in the root directory of the project.**
